                is launching the Tweet Sip cup, a special Starbuzz Coffee cup

                Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. In
                fact, we're going further than any of our competitors and we're
                very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that links
                your coffee drinking directly to your social network. Forget
                "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and with this new
                product every sip of smooth, aromatic, hot Starbuzz blend is
                going to to be shared with your social network.
                <br />
                Sound like science fiction? It's not; I'm already testing our
                final prototype social network cup as I write this, which links
                you, the drinker, right to your favorite social networks. We've
                made a huge investment to make this happen and we've created a
                reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi
                (not to mention a few more things the tech folks know about,
                because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).
                <br />
                So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll be
                releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this new
                invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.
              </p>

              <p>
                Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee house is?
                The lines alway move fast, and despite the astronomical number
                of different drinks any customer can order, we have your drink
                up, hot (or cold if that's the way you want it) and ready in
                seconds. How do we do it?
                <br />
                To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and greatest
                in computer science. In fact, we train our staff to be one big
                distributed computer. The cashiers create the orders for the
                distributed computer, complete with your name and the drinks
                special instructions. Then our specialized drink makers grab the
                next cup and go about working on your order until it's finished.
                <br />
                With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our
                operation any time we want. All we need to do is add more
                cashiers and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of
                support staff you never see) as the customer flow grows.

                Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a customer in
                Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order is a
                "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte, with the
                splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we have unique
                customers or what?
